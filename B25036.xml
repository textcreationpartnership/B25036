         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS We are informed, that upon the noise of a sudden Invasion intended by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to be made into this Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> several of Our Subjects here being not of Our Army, have Armed themselves with Half-Pikes and Skeans; and as We cannot but excuse
<pb facs="tcp:190781:2"/> such of them as made no other use of these Weapons, than to have them ready to defend themselves against their Common <hi>Enemy;</hi> so We cannot without great Dislike, Reflect upon the Proceedings of others of them, who Rob and Spoyl their Neighbours, and Seized upon great numbers of Cattel and other Goods, upon pretence that the Owners thereof were in actual Rebellion against Us: Which if true, the same could be no ground for such irregular Actions. For Rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Abuses, and Preventing the like for the future, We have by the Advice of Our Privy Council thought fit, and do hereby strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charge and Command all such of Our Subjects of this Realm, as do know, or shall know of any Sheep▪ Cows, Horses, or other Goods to be so taken and conveyed away, that they forthwith discover the same to the next Justices of the Peace, who are hereby Required to Restore the same to the Owners and Proprietors thereof. And in case the said Owners or Proprietors are not to be found, or that they be such who are, or have been in Actual Rebellion against Us, that the said Justices of the Peace do cause the said Sheep, Cows, Horses, and other Goods, to be delivered to the Sheriff of the County where such Goods shall be found, who is to give Us an Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and preserve the same until he shall receive Our further Directions therein. And We do further strictly Charge and Command all such of Our People, being not of Our Army, to lay up their Half-Pikes and Skeans in their respective Houses, and that they do not for the future, presume to carry the said Weapons into Fairs, Markets, or other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, upon pain of incurring Our Displeasure, and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against according to Law. And We do by the Advice afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, strictly Charge and Command all Generals, or Governors of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Judges, Justices of the Peace, Magistrates, Sheriffs, and all other Our Officers and Ministers, to take all Lawful ways and means for the apprehending of all such Robbers, Thieves and Plunderers, as well those already guilty, as those who shall commit any of the said Crimes for the future, in order to bring them to condign punishment. We being fully Resolved that such Offenders shall be prosecuted according to the utmost rigour of the Law. And We do hereby strictly Charge and Command▪ all the Officers and Souldiers of our Army to be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and assisting to the Civil Magistrates for the apprehending and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of such Malefactors.</p>
